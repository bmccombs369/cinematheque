### This is an app for people in Atlanta to find others to trade e-juice with. I began the process by planning out my app. First deciding what data models I would need and making the ERDs to see what information they would contain and how they would relate. Then I made wireframes, planning on how to final app would look. Lastly I wrote out a tree for planning what React components I would need and how they would relate. Then I began the programming by first building out the boilerplate for a MERN stack app. Once that was built I made the schema for the data models and began building the routes I would need for the API. Next I built a static version of the app using React before finally going back to make the app dynamic. And I finished the whole process with styling to make the app look more like how I had planned in the wireframes.
